Bare Metal Arm
==============

This is a "bare metal" runtime for the 
[Freescale Freedom FRDM-KL25Z](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=FRDM-KL25Z) 
ARM development board ($13). It builds with the GCC ARM toolchain, with no other external dependencies. 

Quick start on Linux or Mac OS X:
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/payne92/bare-metal-arm.git`
* Grab and unpack GCC ARM toolchain: `cd bare-metal-arm; make gcc-arm`
* `make`

This will create a `demo.srec` image file to flash onto the development board.  (If you're using
the standard bootloader, plug the SDA USB port to a host computer.  On Linux, type `make deploy`.  On other systems,
copy the .SREC file to the FRDM-KL25Z volume.)  

If everything is working, the RGB LEB will flash a few times and then be steady green.  You can access the USB 
SDA serial port (at 115,200 baud) and see the accelerometer and touch input status.

Why do this?
------------

Most vendor provided toolchains are daunting. They're large and complicated because they support a wide
range of processors, libraries, and commerical C compilers.  These tools are usually laden with 
complex configuration tools, lots of source macros and #ifdef statements, and code that's been ported
down several generations of processors.

In contrast, this project is a small (<1,000 lines without USB) simple, and clean bare metal framework that builds 
from the command line.  It has no external library or tool dependencies, only supports GCC, and has minimal use of
assembly.

Walkthrough
-----------

The interrupt vectors and reset code are in `_startup.c`.  The CPU comes out of reset in `_reset_init()` which:
* Copies initialized constant values from flash ROM to RAM
* Configures the main clock (48Mhz)
* Jumps to `_start()` in the Newlib C library

After the C library is done initializing, it invokes `main()` (implemented in `demo.c`).
